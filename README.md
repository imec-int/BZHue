Augment BZflag with the Phlips Hue lights (hacked.io project)

Demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxSIqtMNJ_U

BzHue is a hacking project from the MiXers Sam Decrock, Matthias De Geyter and Robby Wauters.

We wrote a custom (C++) plugin for the open-source game BzFlag where we can process every event in the game.
Those Events are sent to a Node.js Server which controls Philips Hue lights.

Every player has its own custom Philips Hue light which shows information from inside the game, such as:
- Current weapon used
- Killed an enemy
- Being killed
- Being dead
- ...

Thanks to the guys from Hacked.IO and Philips Hue for the great support!
